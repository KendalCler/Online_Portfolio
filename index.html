           <figcaption>Project	Web Trailer Creation
Title	Jurassic Park Trailer Creation 
Origination	Wed Design example for creating a trailer
Date	2 May 2017
Technology	Github, Brackets
Summary (descriptive)	For this project, I designed a trailer page for the movie Jurassic Park. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an appealing trailer page that conveyed the feeling of the movie without being overwhelming. I created this for myself and my professor, but using my web design skills helped me to gain experience and knowledge on what is appealing as a web page.

| Summary (descriptive)	For this presentation, I worked with a teammate to share with our class and professor what we had created: a grant proposal for West Plains Youth Services. This grant proposal was created for a live client working at a non-profit. I wrote the information for the presentation and created a nice layout to share with the class. In my West Plains Youth Services Presentation document, I show my ability to locate information, create a PowerPoint document, represent information appropriately, and include graphics to create an appealing presentation.

          <figcaption>Project: Problem Analysis Project | Title: Public Relations Plan | Origination	Scenario where a grocery store has an outbreak of E. coli, so a crisis plan is needed. | Date: 21 March 2017 | 
Technology	Used: Microsoft Word. | Summary (descriptive): For this project, I was given a scenario in which a food market, “Healthy Foods Haven”, had a branch of their organization distribute unwashed strawberries, which were said to have given those who ate them E. coli. I was to create a crisis management plan that would calm the issue and put the public’s mind at ease. The audience would be anyone shopping at this market, or considering shopping at this market. In this document, I analyze the issue given to me, and propose a solution that shows the companies brand in a positive light while still providing necessary information to the public. I proposed positive events for the company, a full campaign for calming the crisis, and a budget for the campaign costs.
 | Rationale (persuasive): 1.	A Public Relations crisis could happen at any time, and knowing how to put a crisis management plan together could be very beneficial. In this situation, the needs were for the public to be informed in a way that did not cause chaos, and to show the company in a positive light so that they would not lose customers. I created this document with the constraints of real-world consideration; I couldn’t just give the campaign a $1 million budget, I had to consider what is realistic. 2.	This plan had to be created within 24 hours, and had to be complete with research, goals, publics being targeted, objectives, strategies, tactics/tools, budget, sample messaging, and an evaluation on what could have gone better in the theoretical campaign. 3.	I researched similar scenarios to create a more realistic crisis management plan. After research came planning the campaign and creating sample messaging along with a budget. Finally, I evaluated what could have gone better in the campaign. 4.	Through creating this crisis management plan, I better understand the whole process for creating and implementing a campaign.

          <figcaption>Project: Fact Sheet | Title: Public Relations Fact Sheet for Camp Journey | Origination: Needed to create an adequate fact sheet for Camp Journey | Date: 25 April 2017 | Technology:	Microsoft Word | Summary (descriptive):	For this project, I researched an organization called Camp Journey to find all their basic information. I then compiled that information into an easy-to-use document so a representative of the organization may use the information to share their camp’s information to press or other audiences. This fact sheet document shows my ability to design content, write appropriately for my audience, and shows the usability of the content I create.

        <figcaption>Project: Analysis project | Title: Light Shot Task Analysis | Origination: Needed to present a new application to the class. | Date: 30 May 2016 | Technology: Light Shot, Microsoft Excel | Summary (descriptive):	This task analysis was created for keeping the project on task and setting up the times for each task. My task analysis document shows that I can arrange data into logical and considerate structure, as well as conduct productive research as I had to create the tasks and determine nomenclature along with command verbs to go with the document. | Rationale (persuasive): 1. My group was tasked with finding a new application our class had not used before, and setting up steps to show how the application was used. This task analysis was created to show the user exactly what steps need to be taken to use the application. 2. In this task analysis project, I had to consider all steps that needed to be taken. These steps were written in chronological order and color coded. 3.I created this task analysis through careful consideration, and by tracking each step I took to use the application. 4. Through taking careful notes, I generated an easy to follow document.</figcaption>

           <figcaption>Project: Memo | Title:	Madcap Flare Project Memo | Origination: This memo was needed for the preparation of the Madcap Flare Cookbook creation. It informs my professor of what will be made and the deadlines for the project. | Date: 18 April 2017 | Technology: Used Microsoft Word | Summary (descriptive): For this memo, I organized my ideas for the Madcap Flare Cookbook into a single page, giving information on when specific parts of the project would be completed and how I would create the cookbook so that it represented my knowledge and skill of Madcap Flare. The audience for this memo was my professor. In the memo, I discussed the content for the project, timelines for when each section of content would be due, and verification on whether I would be taking the certification exam for Madcap Flare. This document shows that I know how to identify tasks, create a timeline, and report information back to my supervisor. | Rationale (persuasive): 1. The professional situation was that my professor wanted to be informed on what I was creating and when it would be created. The constraint was that my cookbook be done within a certain amount of time, and that it meets the standards for Madcap Flare certification. 
2. I was tasked with creating the memo in an appropriate format so that the content was understandable and the dates given were accurate. 3. I set up timelines and gave accurate information. Creating the cookbook so that it proves my memo accurate will be the next step for this document. 4. By writing this memo, I kept my professor informed, narrowed down my steps for creating the cookbook, and showed my knowledge of memo writing.

          <figcaption>Project: Project Report | Title: iFixit Guide Project Report | Origination: Online guide created for iFixit to supply users with information on how to disassemble and reassemble the PHILIPS Portable DVD Player. | Date:	23 October 2015 | Technology Used: Microsoft Word, a camera, Light Shot Studio equipment, PHILIPS Portable DVD Player, and iFixit brand tools. | Summary (descriptive):	For this project report, I documented what had been done, what is being done, and what will be done for the iFixit guide that my teammates and I were working on. I wrote an introduction on what piece of equipment my team and I were working with, and what I would be informing the professor of in this document. I thoroughly explained what my team and I had each done at this point of the project, and what we were currently working on. I then gave a list of what still needed to be done for the completion of the iFixit guide. I then closed the report by stating what resources we needed and whether the guide would be completed on schedule. The professor and myself were the only people to see the report. This report shows that I can provide results and present them to my supervisor in an appropriate manner and exemplifies my writing skills. | Rationale (persuasive):	1.	My team needed to keep our professor informed of what was happening and when. Without this report, the professor would not have known if we were behind other groups or were not creating quality work. The report had to be clear on what was happening and who was doing what tasks. 2. When creating this report, I had to inform the professor of who was doing what tasks during the project. In the iFixit guide, I was using my abilities to aid all the group members to produce the best work that they could, and was doing any tasks that were needed, including lighting, working on the project proposal, helping to create the iFixit troubleshooting page. 3. I created the report through compiling information given by me team and through my own knowledge. 4. Through creating this document, I provided my professor and teammates with a clear plan and updates on the project.

          <figcaption>Project: Comprehensive Edit | Title: Portable Light Studio Editing Project | Origination: Poor quality instructions for the Portable Light studio photography packet. | Date: 28 November 2016 | Technology: Edited by hand | Summary (descriptive): For this project, I received instructions for the use of the Portable Light Studio kit that were poorly written. The instructions had numerous errors that made them difficult to understand or confusing. The audience for the product information would be the North American market: generally, English speakers who have a high level of interest in photography but could be novice as well as expert photographers. These documents represent skills required for comprehensively editing, copyediting, and proofreading a document. The series of documents demonstrate the process I went through. The final product shows how I improved the document through editing.
